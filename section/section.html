        <h1>The power of Failure</h1>
        <p class="quote">"The secret of life is to fall seven times and to get up eight times." — Paulo Coelho</p>
        <p>Failure is something that we look down upon, something that we pity having, something that makes us sad, and sometimes even makes us question ourselves.</p>
        <p>Why is this so? Why is our subconscious drilling to look at failure as something so EVIL when it teaches us SO much more in reality?</p>
        <p>Failure is a part of life.</p>
        <p>Someone once said, “if you never fail, you will never grow,” Until yesterday, I never believed this saying. I thought, how can someone LEARN when they lose? How can someone grow when all their hard work and effort is gone in vain? But Boy, was I wrong.</p>
        <p>When I felt my first failure, I thought that the work I had put my soul into was not enough; I felt heartbroken. I didn’t know what to do next; I felt lost.</p>
        <p>But after my moping was over. The world didn’t end; the sun rose the following day, and I was very much ALIVE. So I questioned myself why I was FEELING so bad when I had gained so much in reality. I was more self-aware than ever before, and most importantly, I had the urge to improve myself, which, now that I think about it, I would not have felt this way if I had succeeded. I would be happy to achieve the achievement I had received and work on my role. I would have thought I was enough and going the right way. But failure taught me I have yet to discover so much potential in myself. I have yet to work on the thing I felt I was good at. It has helped me want to try and explore.</p>
        <p>What would have happened if Einstein had given up the first time he failed to invent the Light bulb; we probably would be living in a world of Candles and lamps.</p>
        <p>I had always felt I would be the happiest when I succeeded, and in some way, I would be but with failure, I get to be the most SELF-AWARE person I am to date, and to me, it is a very BIG win. So to all the people who are afraid to grab the opportunity just because you are scared of FAILURE, go for it. FAILURE teaches you hundreds of ways you can discover yourself.</p>
        <p>You can either mop around and be insecure about yourself or WORK on yourself the choice is yours. So start from today and enjoy the lessons failure has provided because one failure teaches us something 1000 of success can never teach it helps us work on ourselves it helps us GROW. Go and Celebrate your failure and channel your power of failure because every failure is a more notable success in life.</p>
